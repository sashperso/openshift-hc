= Red Hat OpenShift Health Check Report

:sectnums:
== *Disclaimer*

_This health check provides a best effort evaluation of the targeted OCP cluster(s). The results from the
report do not in any way provide a guarantee or warranty for the health and performance of the targeted
OCP cluster(s). The health check aims to provide an indication of overall health and provide consultant
recommendations on a best effort basis._


This health check has been conducted by Harry-Potter for Voldemort.

== *Introduction*
Red Hat is a leading global provider of open-source software solutions, renowned for its commitment to providing enterprise-level solutions built on the principles of open collaboration. Founded in 1993, the company has played a pivotal role in advancing the adoption of Linux and open-source technologies in corporate environments. One of Red Hat's flagship products is OpenShift, a robust container orchestration platform that simplifies the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. OpenShift leverages Kubernetes, an open-source container orchestration system, and extends its capabilities to offer a comprehensive container platform with features such as automated scaling, load balancing, and integrated security. This platform facilitates the development and operation of cloud-native applications, allowing organizations to embrace the agility and scalability of containerization while maintaining the stability and security required for enterprise environments. Red Hat's dedication to open-source values and its innovative solutions, such as OpenShift, have positioned it as a key player in the ever-evolving landscape of modern IT infrastructure.


Conducting an OpenShift Health Check is a strategic move for organizations leveraging this container orchestration platform, offering a range of benefits crucial for maintaining optimal performance and security. Firstly, a health check ensures that the OpenShift environment is aligned with recommended practices, identifying potential misconfigurations or vulnerabilities that could compromise system integrity. This proactive approach helps preemptively address issues before they escalate, minimizing downtime and enhancing overall system reliability. Additionally, a health check provides insights into resource utilization and performance bottlenecks, allowing for fine-tuning and optimization of the OpenShift deployment to maximize efficiency. Security concerns are addressed through a comprehensive review, identifying and remedying potential vulnerabilities. Conducting the health check in a container provides the health check with the required dependencies smoothly and with complete isolation from the host system. Ultimately, an OpenShift Health Check contributes to the long-term stability of the platform, ensuring that it continues to meet the evolving needs of the organization while maintaining a secure and well-performing containerized infrastructure.


Harnessing the efficiency of automation with Ansible and Containerization technology, our Health Check process seamlessly operates within a container, delivering a user-friendly and insightful PDF report. This streamlined workflow involves providing authentication credentials to the OpenShift Container Platform (OCP) cluster, constructing a container image equipped with all necessary dependencies for the Health Check, establishing a designated directory for the container to mount and generate the PDF, and finally, executing the container with the custom-built image. The resulting PDF can be easily customized to meet the specific needs of our clients by our dedicated consultants.

== *Key*

== *Networks*
The network check looks into the entire OCP cluster and observes which Ingress policies have not been admitted to a network. 


=== List of routes that have not been admitted
****
image::/home/images/good.png[image,50,50]
There are no routes that have not been admitted, which reflects that all the Ingress policies in the cluster have been admitted. 
****


== *Persistent Storage*

Persistent storage in OpenShift uses the Kubernetes persistent volume (PV) framework that allows cluster administrators to provision persistent storage for a cluster. Developers use persistent volume claims (PVCs) to request PV resources without having specific knowledge of the underlying storage infrastructure.  PVCs are specific to a project while PV resources on their own are not scoped to any single project. After a PV is bound to a PVC, that PV can not then be bound to additional PVCs.  PVCs can exist in the system that are not owned by any container. This may be intentional, if the PVC is to be retained for future use.

=== Storage Classes

StorageClass objects describes and classifies storage that can be requested and serve as a management mechanism for controlling different levels of storage and access to that storage.  

The following storage classes are defined in the cluster:

[cols="1,1"]

== *Kubelets*
The following checks are occurring on the master nodes. 

=== Authentication
Anonymous authentication should be preferably set to false, in order for users to identify themselves before authentication to API.

****
The node is lab-master-1


image::/home/images/good.png[image,50,50]

      "enabled": false

      "enabled": false
****
****
The node is lab-master-3


image::/home/images/good.png[image,50,50]

      "enabled": false
****

=== Pods
podsPerCore sets the number of pods the node can run based on the number of processor cores on the node. podsPerCore cannot exceed maxPods (default state of maxPods is 250 pods with 4096 podPidsLimit).
****
The node is lab-master-1

  "maxPods": 250,

  "podPidsLimit": 4096,

The node is lab-master-2

  "podPidsLimit": 4096,

The node is lab-master-3

  "maxPods": 250,

  "podPidsLimit": 4096,

****
=== APIs
The rate at which the kubelet talks to the API server depends on queries per second (QPS) and burst values. The default values 50 for kubeAPIQPS and 100 for kubeAPIBurst, are good enough if there are limited pods running on each node. Updating the kubelet QPS and burst rates is recommended if there are enough CPU and memory resources on the node.
****
The node is lab-master-1

  "rotateCertificates": true,
****

=== CgroupDriver
Cgroupfs and systemd are the predominant cgroup drivers. The preferred driver is systemd as it is tightly integrated with cgroups and will assign a cgroup to each systemd unit. Using cgroupfs with systemd means that there will be two different cgroup managers( ie two views of the resources)

----
Fast disks are the most critical factor for etcd deployment performance and stability. A slow disk will increase ETCD request latency and potentially hurt cluster stability. Because etcd maintains a detailed record of its keyspace over time, it's necessary to regularly condense this history to prevent performance issues and avoid running out of storage space. Compacting the keyspace history removes information about keys that are no longer relevant before a specific revision, making the space used by these keys available for new data. The compaction process should be quick, ideally below 100ms (typically below 10ms for fast storage types like SSD/NVMe or AWS io1) for smaller clusters, but it can take up to 800ms for larger clusters (20 or more workers). Anything beyond 800ms could lead to performance problems.



This Health check is checking compaction rate and is assuming its for a large cluster and rounding off to closest integer of milliseconds.
****

Compaction Rate:   0 milliseconds
****

The following is conducting the fio test (by spinning up a container in the master node, some crazy calculations happening in background, just retrieving the last important lines)  and checks the results provide the 99th percentile of fsync and if it is in the recommended threshold to host etcd or not. 
****
INFO: 99th percentile of fsync is 5931008 ns


image::/home/images/good.png[image,50,50]
INFO: 99th percentile of the fsync is within the recommended threshold: - 10 ms, the disk can be used to host etcd
