Overview of To-Do:

- Consult with PM to go over the plan.
- Consult with a senior/architect to goover the design. 
- Identify when the next meetings will bel held.
- Which Platform to use ? FT or demo.redhat.com
- Create a reposotory (in Gitlab?) for work
- Decide on technologies to use ? 
-- Ansilbe automation running playbooks from a VM
-- Ansible containers runnin playbooks inside pods. 

Technical Automation overview: 
- Complete a checklist of what the automation script needs to have.
-- Health check status output for nodes
--- check health of nodes
--- check PDBs (PodDisruptionBudgets) to make sure nothing is going to require manual intervention.. or plan for manual intervention
review deployments with rs <2 and communicate re: outages to app teams (small # of app teams)
--- Check and confirm health of co, remediate
--- check for pending pods
--- check for pending csr (Certificate Signing Request), approve/deny
--- inspect node resource availability to ensure room for drained apps 
--- check and confirm maxUnavailable

-- Health check status output for 
--- pods
--- etcd
--- machineconfigpool
--- kubelets
--- certificates
--- network traffics
--- operators
--- subscriptions
--- alerts
--- prometheus
--- grafana
--- used/unused PVCs
--- internal image registry

Review the technical details with Senior/Architect. 

Create the playbook with given technical scopes. 

Out of Scope:
- Checks of any applications running on the OCP.

Create documentation on `detailed` explanation on what the script does and how to implement it. 

Create documentation on `How-to` which only deals with performing the automated health checks.
